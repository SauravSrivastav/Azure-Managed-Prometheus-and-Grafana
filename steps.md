Monitoring the performance of an AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) cluster is crucial for ensuring its reliability and stability. To achieve this, you need a monitoring solution that can track metrics, logs, and other important data. Two popular tools for monitoring Kubernetes clusters are Prometheus and Grafana. In this blog post, we will explore how to set up and use managed Prometheus and managed Grafana to monitor your AKS cluster.

Managed Prometheus

Azure offers a managed Prometheus service called Azure Monitor for containers. This service makes it easy to collect and analyze metrics from your AKS cluster. Here are the steps to set up Azure Monitor for containers:

1. Create an AKS cluster: If you haven't already created an AKS cluster, follow the instructions in the Azure documentation to create one.

2. Enable container monitoring: In the Azure portal, navigate to your AKS cluster and click on "Monitoring" in the left-hand menu. Click "Enable" to enable container monitoring.

3. Create a Log Analytics workspace: Azure Monitor for containers requires a Log Analytics workspace to store metrics data. If you don't already have a workspace, create one in the Azure portal.

4. Install the Azure Monitor for containers agent: To collect metrics data from your AKS cluster, you need to install the Azure Monitor for containers agent on each node in the cluster. You can do this manually or using a script provided by Azure.

5. Configure data retention: By default, Azure Monitor for containers retains metrics data for 30 days. You can change this setting in the Log Analytics workspace settings.

Once you've completed these steps, Azure Monitor for containers will start collecting metrics data from your AKS cluster.

Managed Grafana

Azure also offers a managed Grafana service called Azure Monitor for Grafana. This service provides a pre-configured Grafana instance that connects to your Azure Monitor data sources. Here are the steps to set up Azure Monitor for Grafana:

1. Create a Grafana instance: In the Azure portal, navigate to "Azure Monitor for Grafana" and click "Create." Follow the instructions to create a new Grafana instance.

2. Configure data sources: In Grafana, configure data sources to connect to your Azure Monitor data. You can do this by adding an Azure Monitor data source and providing your Log Analytics workspace ID and primary key.

3. Create dashboards: With your data sources configured, you can create custom dashboards in Grafana to visualize your AKS cluster metrics data.

Managed Grafana makes it easy to create custom dashboards without the need to set up and manage your own Grafana instance.

Conclusion

Monitoring your AKS cluster is essential for ensuring its reliability and stability. With managed Prometheus and managed Grafana, you can easily collect, analyze, and visualize metrics data from your AKS cluster without the need to set up and manage your own monitoring infrastructure.

By following the steps outlined in this post, you can set up Azure Monitor for containers and Azure Monitor for Grafana to monitor your AKS cluster in just a few clicks. These services provide a powerful combination of monitoring tools that will help you keep your AKS cluster running smoothly.
